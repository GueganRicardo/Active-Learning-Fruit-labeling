# AI-Powered Quality Assurance for Food Industry

## Abstract
This project introduces an AI-powered classification system for quality control in the food industry, utilizing computer vision and active learning to enhance efficiency and reliability.

## Key Concepts
- **Active Learning**: Optimizes data acquisition and model performance.
- **Computer Vision**: Analyzes images for defect detection.
- **Quality Control**: Ensures product safety and consistency.

## Introduction
Traditional quality control methods in the food industry are labor-intensive and subjective. Our solution employs AI and computer vision to address these challenges, aiming to reduce manual inspection and improve accuracy.

## System Architecture
The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with active learning to classify images of food products. It incorporates human feedback to refine the AI model and improve classification results.

## Experiments
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with the system achieving high accuracy and reducing the need for manual data labeling.

## Conclusion
Our research presents a novel approach to automating quality control in the food industry, potentially reducing manual labor by 80% and achieving 98% accuracy on classified data.

## Future Work
Future enhancements include background removal from images and mixing query strategies during training to further improve model performance.
